# Changelog

## 0.14.2 — 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Phone-sized touch devices now start on Acceptable/near/MSAA-off unless that browser
  already has an explicit graphics preference.
- Mobile rendering uses absolute 540p/720p/900p pixel ceilings for
  Acceptable/Standard/Blessing and never renders duplicate frames above 60 FPS.

### Fixed

- High-DPR 90/120 Hz phones no longer multiply the scene, post-process, and MSAA fill
  cost from desktop-oriented pixel ratios and uncapped presentation.

## 0.14.1 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Courier cars now park at the road-facing edge of their POI instead of receiving
  an unrelated lateral offset that could hide later couriers behind the site.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-09-11

### Added

- Physical courier cars placed deterministically at roadside POIs every 6–12 km, with a distinct shader finish and persistent eight-cell trunks.
- Four permanent physical parcel contracts per courier, transferable through hands, loose-item storage, and vehicle trunks.
- Signed sticker envelopes that replace delivered parcels atomically and can be stored, dropped, transferred, and applied to any normal car.
- Modal sticker placement preview with wheel rotation, confirm/cancel controls, painted-panel filtering, and full-footprint validation.
- Persistent courier storage, completed-contract IDs, physical reward migration, and save-code round trips for contracts and stickers.
- Recurring roadside mirage tableaus, expanded sandstone cities, shipwreck silhouettes, moon/grade/climb lab tooling, and boot warm-up diagnostics.
- Source vehicle-import archives and visual proof/reference files used by the current vehicle and sticker work.

### Removed

- The abstract freight job, destination-sign, pallet, `WorldState.job`, `stickersUnplaced`, and delivered-POI progression path.
- Immediate counter-driven sticker placement without a physical envelope or preview.
- Fixed full-cap traffic density and the old dense-traffic overtaking gate.

### Changed

- Traffic count is now a natural varying population below the configured cap, with per-driver following distances and overtaking at every supported density.
- Ambient traffic headlights fade with distance while the driven car keeps its authored beam strength.
- Headlights use warmer period-correct colour, softer edges, and less clipping; midnight receives readable moonlit terrain fill.
- Autopilot yields headlight ownership after a manual switch until it is re-engaged.
- Mirage cities now use varied wall colours, windows, balconies, roof caps, and street strips while retaining instanced rendering.
- World boot waits for the requested road-chunk and desert-tile windows instead of treating an empty scheduler as complete.
- Traffic engine voices use a broader, quieter combustion spectrum with stronger distance falloff.

### Fixed

- Resumed drives no longer begin before support colliders and nearby terrain are ready.
- Traffic density reductions remove safe behind-player cars instead of visibly popping arbitrary vehicles.
- Ambient headlight pools no longer appear at full brightness when distant traffic spawns or enters the light budget.
- Manual headlight changes are no longer overwritten on the next autopilot step.
- Autopilot obstacle passing, recovery, lane holding, and following remain stable across curves, grades, hazards, parked vehicles, and opposing traffic.
- Mirage placement, wreck spacing, sandstone-city readability, sky fill, and distant transition behaviour were corrected.
- Delivered cargo cannot mint a second reward, and cancelled or invalid sticker placement cannot consume its envelope.
